mc_question(
  title,
  ...,
  points = 1,
  nr_answers = 5,
  random_answer_order = TRUE,
  mc = TRUE,
  title_container = h5,
  static_title = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{title}{question title. Markdown is supported and by default the title will be rendered dynamically if it
contains inline R code.}

\item{...}{answer options created with \code{\link[=answer]{answer()}}.}

\item{points}{total number of points for the question. Set to \code{NULL} to not give any points for the question.
Will be shown next to the question text, formatted using the \code{points_format} given in \code{\link[=exam_config]{exam_config()}}.}

\item{nr_answers}{maximum number of answers to display. At least one correct answer will always be shown.
If \code{NULL}, all answer options are shown. If a vector of length two, the first number specifies the number of
\emph{correct} answers to be shown and the second number specifies the number of \emph{incorrect} answers to be shown.}

\item{random_answer_order}{should the order of answers be randomized? Randomization is unique for every user.}

\item{mc}{show as multiple choice, i.e., allow the user to select more than one answer.}

\item{title_container}{a function to generate an HTML element to contain the question title.}

\item{static_title}{if \code{NULL}, the title will be rendered statically if it doesn't contain inline R code, otherwise
it will be rendered dynamically. If \code{TRUE}, always render the title statically. If \code{FALSE}, always render the
title dynamically on the server.}

\item{label}{answer text to show. Supports markdown formatting and inline code chunks of the form \code{`r value`}.}

\item{correct}{if the answer is correct or not.}

\item{always_show}{even if answer options are randomized, always show this answer.}
